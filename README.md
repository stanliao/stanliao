Programs in this repository:
1. a big number arithmetic (bna) library which compute:
1.1 addition/subtraction/multiplication/division/exponentiation on big integers
1.2 modular addition/subtraction/multiplication/division/exponentiation on big integers
1.3 modular multiplication inverse
1.4 modular square root
1.5 modular elliptic-curve multiplication
2. an interpretor language with the following features:
2.1 Multitasking programming
2.2 Function/variable/constant/structure declaration with namespace resolution
2.3 Untyped elementary vaiables
2.4 Passing arguments by value and passing arguments by reference
2.5 Passing subarray
2.6 Dynamic extension (namespace/function/variable/constant) by .dll/.so files
2.7 Object programming
2.8 C-like syntax
